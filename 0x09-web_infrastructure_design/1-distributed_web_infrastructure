What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works
- Load balancer use different algorithm to serve the function. One of those algorithm is Round Robin algorithm

Round robin algorithm splits tasks sequentially between servers, assuming that there two servers in the clustter/farm, the first server attend to the first request and the second server attends to the second request then the circle repeats itself

Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both
- From our setup and task requirement the load balancer is on Active-Passive setup, where the first server is active and the second server is on standby waiting to come online should the active server fail

What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application
