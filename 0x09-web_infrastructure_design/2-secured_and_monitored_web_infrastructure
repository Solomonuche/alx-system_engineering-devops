What are firewalls for
- A firewall is used to limit or restrict unwanted traffic from a network

Why is the traffic served over HTTPS
- Traffic are served over HTTPS when security of data transmitted is desired

What monitoring is used for
- Monitoring is useful in accessing the state of function of server or network

How the monitoring tool is collecting data
- Monitoring tool collect data using agents this could be snippet of codes inserted into a website

Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem
- Have the same components in the same servers is good for security and performance reasons
Security wise, if one server is compromised the attacker has access to every data
in terms of performance, every component of this server like database server has different memory requirements as such having them seperately improves performance
